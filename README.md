Scripts handling multiplayer concept for D&U, using Steamworks. 
I took it from the main project here on DUA just to show to some people Steam Networking implementation. It is working in a basic level. It would need some Lerp and other implemeentation to handle movements on the clients more smoothly. 
There are two types of multiplayer 1) Local 2) Online
Local multiplayer just handle different inputs; keyboard/mouse, any gamepad (tested Xbox pads and working well) so up to 4 people may be connected to the same computer locally. 
Online Multiplayer uses Steamworks of Steam. Very powerful tool to handle networking comms, lobbies, etc.
