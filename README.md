# MultiplayerSteamNetwork
Scripts handling multiplayer concept for D&U, using Steamworks. 
I took it from the main project here on DUA just to show to some people Steam Networking implementation. It is working in a basic level. It would need some Lerp and other implemeentation to handle movements on the clients more smoothly.
